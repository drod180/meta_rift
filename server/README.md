# Meta-Rift Backend

### Running the server

Eventually, the backend will be entirely on AWS and will use environmental variables. In the meantime, the API can be set up and tested according to the following instructions.

#### Step 1: Setting up environment variables

The following environment variables are used:  
`meta_rift_riot_key` - Riot API key to fetch data with.

Setting environment variables:  
**Windows**  
From the command line run as admin:  
`setx meta_rift_riot_key "[KEY]"`  
replace [KEY] with your Riot API key.

**Ubuntu**  
From the command line run:  
`export meta_rift_riot_key=[KEY]`  
replace [KEY] with your Riot API key.  
This needs to be run on each restart/session, to keep it set add the above line in your profile, e.g. .bash_profile, .zshrc, .bashrc, etc.


#### Step 2: Editing Local Database Information

First, edit the files `src/controllers/champions.py`, `src/db/seeds.py`, and
 `test/model.py` according to the commented instructions in each file.

#### Step 3: Seed the Database with Champions

In `server/src/db`, run `python seeds.py`. (Instructions for updating
  columns coming soon).

#### Step 4: Starting the Server

In the `server` directory, run `gunicorn app`. This will start the server, and calls may be made to the API according to the routes as labeled in `app.py`
